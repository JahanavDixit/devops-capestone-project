## User Story

As a developer working on the customer accounts microservice project,
I need to create an account service that can read, update, and delete customer accounts
so that the customer account information can be easily managed.

## Description

The customer accounts microservice project aims to provide a centralized location for managing customer account information for the organization. The first sprint will focus on creating the account service, which will allow users to read, update, and delete customer accounts. The accounts service database will contain basic information about customer names and addresses.

## Tasks

- [ ] Set up the project repository and initial file structure
- [ ] Define the account service API endpoints and data schema
- [ ] Implement account service CRUD functionality
- [ ] Set up the accounts service database and connect to the application
- [ ] Write automated tests for account service functionality
- [ ] Implement logging and error handling for the account service
- [ ] Create documentation for the account service API

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a user has valid credentials,
When the user requests to create a new account with valid information,
Then the new account should be created in the accounts service database.

Given a user has valid credentials,
When the user requests to update an existing account with valid information,
Then the existing account should be updated in the accounts service database.

Given a user has valid credentials,
When the user requests to delete an existing account,
Then the account should be deleted from the accounts service database.

## Assumptions

- Customer names and addresses will be stored in a single database table.
- Customers will be identified by a unique account ID.
- The account service will be deployed using a containerization tool such as Docker.
